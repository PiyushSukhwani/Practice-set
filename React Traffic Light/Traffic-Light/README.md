# Traffic Light Simulation

This project is a React-based traffic light simulation where the lights switch from green to yellow to red after predetermined intervals and loop indefinitely. Each light is lit for a specific duration, and the appearance of the traffic light can be creatively styled.

## Light Durations

- **Red Light**: 4000ms
- **Yellow Light**: 5000ms
- **Green Light**: 3000ms

## Features

- **Automated Light Switching**: The traffic light automatically switches colors at the specified intervals.
- **Infinite Loop**: The light cycle continues indefinitely.
- **Customizable Appearance**: The style and appearance of the traffic light can be customized.
